This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript: implicit type coercion.  VBScript's lack of explicit type declarations can lead to unexpected results when performing operations on variables of different types. The `bug.vbs` file showcases a function with this issue.  The solution (`bugSolution.vbs`) demonstrates the importance of explicit type declarations for improved code clarity and reliability.
